"problemStatementFull": "Gender achievement gaps in education have been well-documented over the years – studies consis-tently find boys outperforming girls on math tests and girls outperforming boys on reading and language tests. A particularly controversial article was published in Science in 1980 arguing that this pattern was due to an ‘innate’ difference in ability (focusing on mathematics rather than on reading and language). Such views persisted in part because studying systematic patterns in achievement nationwide was a challenge due to differential testing standards across school districts and the general lack of availability of large-scale data. It is only recently that data-driven research has begun to reveal socioeconomic drivers of achieve-ment gaps. The Standford Educational Data Archive (SEDA), a publicly available database onacademic achievement and educational opportunity in U.S. schools, has supported this effort. The database is part of a broader initiave aiming to improve educational opportunity by enabling re- searchers and policymakers to identify systemic drivers of disparity. SEDA includes a range of detailed data on educational conditions, contexts, and out- comes in school districts and counties across the United States. It includes measures of academic achievement and achievement gaps for school districts and counties, as well as district-level measures of racial and socioeconomic composition, racial and socioeco-nomic segregation patterns, and other features of the schooling system. The database standardizes average test scores for schools 10,000 U.S. school districts relative to national standards to allow comparability between school districts and across grade levels and years. The test score data come from the U.S. Department of Education. In addition, multiple data sources (American Community Survey and Common Core of Data) are integrated to provide district-level socioeconomic and demographic information. Assignment objectives In this assignment, you’ll explore achievement gaps in California school districts in 2018, repro- ducing the findings described in the article above on a more local scale and with the most recent SEDA data. You’ll practice the following: \n • review of data documentation • assessment of sampling design and scope of inference \n • data tidying operations – slicing and filtering – merging multiple data frames – pivoting tables – renaming and reordering variables \n • constructing exploratory graphics and visualizing trends • data aggregations \n • narrative summary of exploratory analysis",
